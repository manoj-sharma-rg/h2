# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The goal is to automate the integration of new Property Management Systems (PMS) with our hospitality platform by standardizing incoming messages into the RGBridge format. This will streamline onboarding, reduce manual mapping, and ensure robust, validated, and auditable data flows between PMSs and our internal systems.

---

## 2. Objectives

- **Automate PMS Integration:** Enable rapid, low-code onboarding of new PMSs by defining mappings and translation logic.
- **Standardize Data:** Convert diverse PMS message formats (JSON, XML, GraphQL) into a unified RGBridge XML format.
- **Validation & Reliability:** Ensure all incoming and outgoing messages are schema-validated, logged, and error-handled.
- **Extensibility:** Allow new PMS integrations via a plugin system with minimal code changes.
- **Maintainability:** Store mappings in a human-friendly, version-controlled format (YAML).
- **User Experience:** Provide a user interface for analysis, monitoring, and documentation.

---

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
- API gateway endpoints for each PMS (e.g., `/pmscode`).
- Schema validation for incoming PMS messages and outgoing RGBridge XML.
- Static mapping knowledge base (YAML/DB) for attribute/tag mapping.
- Plug-and-play PMS translators (auto-discovered).
- Common utilities for date, currency, LOS pattern, etc.
- Posting RGBridge XML to internal API with retry and error handling.
- Automated tests (unit/integration).
- User interface for monitoring, mapping review, and documentation.
- CI/CD and cloud deployment readiness.

### Out of Scope
- Real-time UI for mapping creation (initially).
- Dynamic mapping updates at runtime (initially).
- PMS-side development or support.

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 API Gateway
- Expose REST endpoints for each PMS (e.g., `/pmscode`).
- Authenticate incoming requests.
- Log all requests and responses.

### 4.2 Message Validation
- Validate incoming PMS messages against their schema (JSON Schema, XML XSD, etc.).
- Validate outgoing RGBridge XML against XSD.

### 4.3 Mapping Knowledge Base
- Store attribute/tag mappings per PMS in YAML files (or optionally in a DB).
- Support direct attribute mapping; transformation logic handled in code/utilities.
- Auto-detect obvious mappings; flag unclear mappings for review.

### 4.4 Translation Logic
- For each PMS, provide two translation methods (one for each RGBridge message type).
- Extract values from PMS messages using the mapping.
- Use common builder to generate RGBridge XML.

### 4.5 Plugin System
- Auto-discover PMS translators via decorators or class-based plugins.
- Allow easy registration of new PMS translators.

### 4.6 Utilities
- Provide reusable utilities for:
  - Date parsing/formatting
  - Currency conversion/formatting
  - LOS pattern conversion (to RGBridge FullPatternLOS)
  - Boolean/flag handling

### 4.7 Internal API Integration
- POST generated RGBridge XML to internal API endpoint.
- Support authentication and configurable endpoint.
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
- Handle and log acknowledgements and errors.

### 4.8 RestrictionStatus Handling
- Skip unsupported or unknown RestrictionStatus values.

### 4.9 Testing
- Automated unit and integration tests for:
  - Translators
  - Mapping logic
  - API endpoints

### 4.10 User Interface
- Provide a UI for:
  - Monitoring incoming/outgoing messages
  - Reviewing mapping files
  - Viewing documentation

### 4.11 Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation for:
  - System architecture
  - Mapping file format
  - How to add a new PMS
  - API usage

### 4.12 Deployment
- Standalone service, ready for CI/CD and cloud deployment.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Must handle high throughput with low latency.
- **Reliability:** Retry logic for failed posts; robust error handling.
- **Security:** Authentication for all endpoints; secure storage of credentials.
- **Maintainability:** Modular, well-documented codebase.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new PMS integrations.
- **Auditability:** All actions logged for traceability.

---

## 6. Assumptions

- PMS message schemas are known and provided in advance.
- RGBridge XSDs are available for validation.
- Internal API endpoint and authentication details are provided.
- Mappings are static and maintained in version control.

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

- **Schema Drift:** PMS or RGBridge schemas may change. Mitigation: Version mapping files and schemas.
- **Mapping Ambiguity:** Some mappings may not be obvious. Mitigation: Flag for manual review.
- **Plugin Misconfiguration:** New PMS translators may not register correctly. Mitigation: Automated tests and plugin registration checks.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

- New PMS can be integrated by adding a mapping file and a translator class.
- All messages are validated, translated, and posted with error handling.
- System is monitored, testable, and documented.
- UI provides visibility into system operation and mapping logic.
