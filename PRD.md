# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Purpose

To deliver a robust, extensible, and automated integration platform that standardizes diverse PMS (Property Management System) messages into the RGBridge format, enabling seamless onboarding, validation, and monitoring of PMS integrations for the hospitality platform.

---

## 2. Product Overview

The product is a standalone Python (FastAPI) service that:
- Receives PMS messages (JSON, XML, GraphQL) via REST endpoints.
- Validates incoming messages against PMS-specific schemas.
- Translates PMS messages to RGBridge XML using a mapping knowledge base and transformation utilities.
- Validates outgoing RGBridge XML against XSD.
- Posts RGBridge XML to an internal API endpoint with retry and error handling.
- Provides a plugin system for PMS-specific translators.
- Offers a user interface for monitoring, mapping review, and documentation.

---

## 3. Features & Requirements

### 3.1 API Gateway
- REST endpoints for each PMS (e.g., `/pmscode`).
- Authentication for incoming requests (configurable, e.g., API key).
- Logging of all requests and responses.

### 3.2 Message Validation
- Validate incoming PMS messages against their schemas (JSON Schema, XML XSD, etc.).
- Validate outgoing RGBridge XML against provided XSDs.
- Return clear error messages for validation failures.

### 3.3 Mapping Knowledge Base
- Store PMS-to-RGBridge attribute/tag mappings in YAML files (one per PMS).

### 3.4 Translation Logic
- For each PMS, provide two translation methods (one for each RGBridge message type).
- Extract values from PMS messages using the mapping knowledge base.
- Use common builder to generate RGBridge XML.
- Utilities for date, currency, LOS pattern, and boolean/flag conversion.
- Skip unsupported or unknown RestrictionStatus values.

### 3.5 Plugin System
- Auto-discover PMS translators via decorators or class-based plugins.
- Easy registration of new PMS translators.

### 3.6 Internal API Integration
- POST generated RGBridge XML to internal API endpoint (configurable URL and authentication).
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (configurable retries and backoff).
- Handle and log acknowledgements and errors.

### 3.7 User Interface
- Dashboard for monitoring incoming/outgoing messages and errors.
- View and review mapping files.
- Access system and integration documentation.

### 3.8 Testing
- Automated unit and integration tests for translators, mapping logic, and API endpoints.
- Test coverage reports.

### 3.9 Documentation
- System architecture overview.
- Mapping file format and examples.
- Step-by-step guide for adding a new PMS.
- API usage and authentication.

### 3.10 Deployment
- Standalone service, ready for CI/CD and cloud deployment.
- Dockerfile and deployment scripts.

## 4. User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I can add a new PMS by creating a mapping YAML and a translator class, so that new integrations are quick and low-code.
2. **As an operator**, I can monitor all incoming and outgoing messages and errors via a dashboard, so I can ensure system health and trace issues.
3. **As a QA engineer**, I can run automated tests to verify that translations and mappings are correct for each PMS.
4. **As an admin**, I can review and update mapping files in version control, so that mappings are always up to date and auditable.
5. **As a system integrator**, I can view documentation on how to add new PMS integrations and understand the mapping logic.

## 6. Constraints

- PMS message schemas and RGBridge XSDs must be provided and versioned.
- Mappings are static and maintained in version control.
- System must be secure, reliable, and auditable.

---

## 7. Out of Scope

- Real-time UI for mapping creation (initially).
- Dynamic mapping updates at runtime (initially).
- PMS-side development or support.

---

## 8. Open Questions

- What authentication mechanism is required for the internal API endpoint?
- Are there any specific UI/UX requirements for the dashboard?
- Should the system support hot-reloading of mapping files or translators?
